### Summary

Steam-AutoCraft is originally made by 10101000. I'd folk AutoCraft to modify for personal use.

### Usage

Once installed, Steam-AutoCraft adds a new button labeled **AutoCraft remaining badges** to the Steam gamecard page if craft-able badge(s) are detected. Once activated, the script crafts the desired badge, refreshes the page after 10 milli-seconds, and checks for more badge to craft until all the trading cards of that game are used.
